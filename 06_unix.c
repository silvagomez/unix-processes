 * Process IDs in C.
 *
 * In this case id == 0 (child), child wait 1 second with sleep.
 * The parent process will terminate the process.
 * The parent id of the child won't be the parent id, because the parent process
 * dies before the child could execute.
 * So the child is runnig and a new parent proecess is assigned by the system,
 * this is known as ZOMBIE process because is you try to kill it, it's not going
 * to free the memory okay. Memory will not freed = memory leak.
 *
 * So functions that use the fork function, wait for the child processes to
 * finish before you termiante the main process.
